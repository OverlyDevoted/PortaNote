# PortaNote - Portable Note

I take a lot of notes... Like a lot, sometimes while I'm sitting in front of the PC or my phone, or even when I just randomly get a stupid idea about something. For me it's very disorganized, notes are all over the place, so that's why I created this static page prototype for what could be a note taking app. 

I created this site for practicing HTML and CSS flex-box and grid and a potential future app.
